            <article>

                <p>Born and raised in small-town Maine, I enjoy everything outdoors, from relaxing by the beach to a
                    long
                    day spent on the snowy mountains.
                    My first step away from home was a move to St.Louis, MO in 2017 where I began my career in wealth
                    management at Edward Jones. Since then, I have gone on to work for Merrill Lynch
                    and J.P Morgan before settling down at a local firm to grow my client base.
                </p>
                
                <p>I have a strong passion for technology with an increasing desire to learn
                    web development. Throughout my journey, I will use this website to showcase my projects and growing
                    talent.
                </p>

                <P>My intention behind showcasing this first project is to paint an accurate representation of my
                    continuing growth.
                    This was the result of my first intrduction to HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

                <P>For this project, I was given starter HTML and CSS code. I updated the HTML code to follow a semantic
                    structure
                    and changed CSS selectors to coincide with the updates so that the final product was not affected.
